            THE EXPERIENCE<br>
            Working at Hansel has proved a completely unique experience for me, and I can honestly say I've learned (and am continuing to learn) a lot. Though this was both my first time working on mobile application development and working at a startup, I found that I appreciate the work flow and style in which Hansel runs. Though at first, it felt really fast-paced, I grew to appreciate the fact that I always had something to do. I also found that the people I worked with were really encouraging, and helped me grow as a developer by being patient and allowing me to ask all kinds of questions. I couldn't be more grateful for the experience.

            THE EXPERIENCE<br>
            CollegeVine was a great place to work, as it really met me at the intersection of scheduling flexibility and work that makes a difference. My boss made onboarding really smooth and constantly communicated with me, my clients were super eager to learn, and I got to do something I love- teaching.

            THE EXPERIENCE<br>
            I had the privilege of working with Professor Newman one-on-one, conducting research with him for 10 weeks. He taught me a lot about how to analyze and draw conclusions from data, as well as how to properly structure research reports.

            THE EXPERIENCE<br>
            Solar Forward was my first internship and I wouldn't have it any other way. My boss and co-workers were friendly and encouraging, and I really appreciated the workspace and the company culture. The cherry on top was the fact that Solar Forward was trying to save the planet, one solar panel at a time.

            THE EXPERIENCE<br>
            Working at Innov8Social taught me a lot about the impact space and social entrepreneurship. I got to meet some of the most inspiring leaders in today's social impact sphere, and, in the process, learned a bit about what it takes to start a new project altogether. I worked one-on-one with Innov8Social's founder and leader, and am so grateful for the perspective it gave me on using business for good.

            At Kids Korner, I had the opportunity to mentor and teach kids from the ages 4-14, and really enjoyed spending time with them. They were always super energetic and full of spirit, and nothing beats the feeling I got when I was able to teach them something new.

            Naya Zamaana has been my home away from home for the past two years, as it's given me a family with whom I can continue my passion for music. The team has taught me a lot about teamwork and working towards creating something bigger than yourself.

            I joined UConsulting at the end of my sophomore year at UCLA, and was pleasantly surprised at how fast and how much it taught me about consulting. I, along with my peers, completed the accelerator and am looking forward to doing more with them in the future!
