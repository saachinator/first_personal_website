            To preface this, I want to make it clear that I am a very, very <b>essentialist</b> person. What this means is that I only invest time in things that either spark joy, in the words of Marie Kondo, or are necessary for my well-being. I hate clutter and I use very few things, but I make sure to use them extensively and intentionally, and invest time in researching other options before making my decisions. 
            <br> <br>
            That said, a few years ago, I was feeling as though there were so many things I had to do and no effective way of organizing them. As someone who truly finds joy in planning, I was stuck because a lot of my plans existed in my head and I would think about them more than was necessary. Then, I was introduced to Trello, which has become my latest obsession, as it both sparks joy and is necessary for my well-being.
            <br> <br>
            <font size = "6"><b>Let’s start with the basics. What is Trello?</b></font>
                <br><br>
            Trello is a product and project management tool created in 2011 that allows users to create boards with lists and tickets for free. Simply put, it is a glorified list-making application that helps you keep track of everything you have to do.
            <br> <br>
            The reason I say it’s glorified is that it allows you to do the following: <br> <br><b>
                •	Add other users (for projects and collaboration) <br>
                •	Set due dates <br>
                •	Add checklists <br>
                •	Create labels for different categories of tasks <br>
                •	Add descriptions of tickets <br>
                •	Add attachments to tickets <br>
                •	Easily customize your board</b><br> <br>
            It has most of the functionalities necessary to organize your to-do list and add details where you see fit. Best of all, you can completely tailor it to your needs!</p>
            
            <center><img src= "TrelloBoard.png" style= "width: 60%;"/> </center>
            
            <p style= "text-align: left; line-height: 1.85; padding-bottom: 7%; width: 60%">
                
            <font size = "6"><br><b>What Makes Trello Special?</b></font> <br><br>
            In today’s work-driven culture, you’ll often hear people say that they’re busy or that they have “so much to do.” As a society, we are always planning and trying to organize our lives. Oftentimes, we end up just falling short because of the sheer amount we have to keep track of.
            <br><br>
            What Trello does is it simplifies this arduous process of list making and project organizing by providing a platform that is truly essentialist. What this means is that nothing about Trello is an unnecessary feature. While many other project management platforms have features that go unused, such as the ability to integrate analytics (which isn’t necessary for personal use nor for purely software development oriented platforms), Trello is simple and, as a result, truly effective. 
            <br><br>
            It’s also incredibly versatile. I’ve used Trello boards for software development projects, management consulting projects, and my own life (Yes, I have a personal Trello board that I update daily. It’s called “saachinator&co” and my current board is posted above). If I get tired of organizing it a certain way, I can switch up the format within minutes and tailor it to my current needs. It’s so intuitive and easy in that way. <br>
                <font size = "6"><br><b>Trello is <i>Almost</i> Perfect</b></font> <br><br>
            As you can probably tell, I am a HUGE advocate for Trello. I think everyone should invest time in making a personal Trello board and I’ve even showed it to a few friends who decided to start using it soon after!
            <br> <br>
            However, there are a few key things I wish Trello allowed me, as a user, to do: <br> <br>
                •	<b>Create dependencies between tickets</b>- If I have to complete one task in order to start another, I’d like for Trello to know that and remind me to complete the first one first. This can be done in a few ways:<br>
                1.	Automatically make cards that are dependent on one another a different color based on how many cards they are dependent on<br>
                2.	Create a web (or path) between the cards in a dependency line whenever one in the line is clicked on<br>
                3.	Show dependences for a card in the checklist of a given card<br><br>
            •	<b>Visually demonstrate tickets that have upcoming deadlines</b>- Perhaps a red glow could appear around tickets that have due dates within 2 days, and an orange glow could appear around those within 5 days, for example<br><br>
             
            <font size = "6"><b>Final Thoughts</b></font> <br><br>
                As a whole, I’ve been able to effectively organize my life and other projects using Trello for years now. It’s such a powerful tool that gives the user a lot of freedom. If you haven’t tried it already, I would highly recommend <a href="https://trello.com/en-US" target="_blank"><u>checking it out</u></a>. Who knows, maybe you’ll end up with a personal board like me!
